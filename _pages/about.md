I'm Dev, a Ph.D. candidate in David Smith's lab of Neurobiology of Learning and Memory at Cornell University. 

My research
======
I'm studying the spatial encoding mechanisms in the Retrosplenial Cortex and the Hippocampus. These two regions are involved in encoding spatial and contextual memory but the way in which these two regions encode spatial information is different. I'm trying to understand the differences in their encoding patterns. My long term goal is to understand these differences and implementing them in artificial intelligence agents in the hope of making better AI. I analyze rodent neurophysiogical data to decode the spatial information representation in the two aforementioned brain regions. I'm also interested in building a model of spatial information encoding mechanism that supports spatial-contextual memory in these regions.

Background and my switch to Neuroscience
======
I did my Undergrad in Electronics and Communication Engg. from National institute of technology, Bhopal, India. During that time, I had an existential crisis which lead me to introspect and think about the purpose of life and our place within the universe. I realized that the tool that we use to understand the universe, i.e. the brain, is itself a mystery. So, I thought if we don't understand the brain properly, then our understanding of the universe will also be limited. That was the start of my passion for Neuroscience. At that time, I did many online courses to understand the basics of Neuroscience. Then I went on to do a Masters in Neuroscience at University of Texas at Dallas. There, I joined the lab of Lucien Thompson and learned electrophysiological techniques to understand the information encoding patterns in the Hippocampus during spatial navigation. After completing my Masters, I joined Cornell for my Ph.D.

My hobbies and life
======
Apart from my research, I like to have intellectual conversations about various different topics like AI, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Astronomy etc. I live in a grad co-op at Cornell with 12 other people from various countries and parts of the world, which contributes to a rich experience in learning and knowing about the various cultures across the planet. It inspires me to know that the nobel laureate, Hans Bethe, used to live at this co-op. I also like to do star-gazing, hiking, and playing sports. I'm the captain of the Cornell cricket team and also the vice-president of the cricket club.
