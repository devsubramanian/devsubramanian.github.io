I'm Dev and I graduated with a Ph.D. degree in July 2024 from [David Smith's][lab_website] lab of Neurobiology of Learning and Memory at [Cornell University][university]. I'm currently looking for job opportunities in Neuroscience-based data science/machine learning positions in universities/industry/research institutes. Here's my [résumé][resume].


My research
------

I'm studying the neural basis of the Episodic memory in the Retrosplenial Cortex and the Hippocampus. One of the projects I completed involved the comparison of spatial and contextual memory encoding in these two brain regions using various analytic techniques. Recently, I discovered 'time cells' in the Retrosplenial Cortex and analyzed the mechanisms of temporal encoding in that brain region. One of my long-term goals is to understand the patterns of neuronal firing and implement them in artificial intelligence agents in the hope of making better AI. Another long-term goal is to contribute to the development of better treatment for people affected with brain disorders and also the development of non-invasive devices that can be used to track our brain health in our day-to-day lives, much like we use devices to track physical health nowadays.  


Background and my switch to Neuroscience
------

I did my Undergrad in Electronics and Communication Engg. from [National institute of technology, Bhopal][ug], India. During that time, I had an existential crisis which lead me to introspect and think about the purpose of life and our place within the universe. I realized that the tool that we use to understand the universe, i.e. the brain, is itself a mystery. So, I thought if we don't understand the brain properly, then our understanding of the universe will also be limited. That was the start of my passion for Neuroscience. At that time, I did many online courses to understand the basics of Neuroscience. Then I went on to do a Masters in Neuroscience at [University of Texas at Dallas][masters]. There, I joined the lab of [Lucien Thompson][lab_utd] and learned electrophysiological techniques to understand the information encoding patterns in the Hippocampus during spatial navigation. After completing my Masters, I joined Cornell for my Ph.D.


My hobbies and life
------

Apart from my research, I like to have intellectual conversations about various different topics like AI, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Astronomy etc. Currently, I live in a grad co-op at Cornell called [Gamma Alpha][house] with 12 other people from various countries and parts of the world, which contributes to a rich experience in learning and knowing about the various cultures across the planet. It inspires me to know that the Nobel laureate, [Hans Bethe][nobel], was a member of this co-op. I also like to go star-gazing, hiking, and playing sports. I'm the vice-president of the [Cornell cricket club][cricket] and also play for the team.
